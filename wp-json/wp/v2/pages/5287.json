Cancel anytime at all right from your account page.While I&#8217;ll hate to see you leave, the last thing I want to do is keep you here if you don&#8217;t want to be. You deserve better than that.Also, I personally hate it when membership sites I use make it hard to cancel, so I made sure there&#8217;s a simple process.<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Are your System videos on YouTube?<\/h4>\n<p>You&#8217;ve gotten a TON of free instruction from us on YouTube (and will continue to get more). That&#8217;s our gift to you.<strong>But every video inside the Top Speed Golf System courses are 100% exclusive to this website. We won&#8217;t release these anywhere else.<\/strong>That&#8217;s partly because they take you step-by-step through the training, building on one another. It&#8217;s simply impossible to do a proper course-based system like this on YouTube.And of course, it&#8217;s also because paying members deserve to get stuff no one else does.So, with your All Access Membership, you&#8217;re going to get videos you&#8217;ve never seen before (and will never see anywhere else), as well as a true, structured, systematic learning program to maximize your playing ability.YouTube&#8217;s great &#8212; but you need more than it can offer. The All Access Membership is where you&#8217;ll get it!<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Do you provide video reviews for members?<\/h4>\n<p>We do have an Unlimited Reviews program for an incredibly reasonable price, which you can sign up for after becoming an All Access Member (if there are spots available).However, there are <strong>no free reviews<\/strong> included with the membership.I would love to provide this, but currently I can&#8217;t offer analysis with the membership. For the low price that I&#8217;m charging, I&#8217;m simply not able to offer analysis of your swing by an instructor.<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4>How long will this super-low pricing last?<\/h4>\n<p>Perhaps not much longer!We&#8217;ve already had to raise prices once to support our growth.The membership&#8217;s been around for about 3 years now, and I&#8217;ve been able to add content to the site faster than expected. So, the value has grown tremendously from when we first launched.And there&#8217;s more coming!To continue providing what you want and need, we do expect to charge more before long.But think of how smart you&#8217;ll feel when you&#8217;re paying way less than everyone who misses out on this offer :-)I recommend you lock in your rate today because you&#8217;ll be protected from any future price increases.<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Is your checkout process secure?<\/h4>\n<p>I take site security very seriously.You can see we have enacted full site SSL (the green lock in the address bar), which is rare outside the banking industry.In fact, <strong>w<\/strong><strong>e got an &#8220;A&#8221; rating on the highly respected Qualys SSL Labs check<\/strong>.That ranks higher than the huge bank Wells Fargo!In fact, I had more than one person tell me that we were overdoing it for a site like ours. But the last thing I want is any security issues or our members feeling uneasy about our trustworthiness.In addition, <strong>we do not collect or store any of your credit card data<\/strong> on our site\/server. We simply securely transmit it to our fully PCI-compliant payment processor, Stripe.You can find out all about their security safeguards here: https:\/\/stripe.com\/help\/security<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Are there limits on video viewing?<\/h4>\n<p>Absolutely not!While you are an All Access Member, you can watch any video, at any time, as often as you like.Of course, if you cancel your membership, you&#8217;ll no longer have access to the videos.<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4>How does this compare to what you taught in the past?<\/h4>\n<p>The prior system I worked with had the goal of teaching students to develop a &#8220;perfect golf swing.&#8221; The idea is that over time you will continually eliminate all of the flaws in your swing.The difficulty I had with the system is that a lot of these small flaws don&#8217;t effect your play or your score hardly at all.For example, Nicklaus had a flying elbow at the top, Greg Norman was across the line, Tiger Woods dropped too much in the downswing, Hogan had a cupped left wrist, and so on.One thing that I realized over time is that most players spend huge amounts of time practicing the things that don&#8217;t matter and very little time practicing the things that do matter.I know that anyone can improve if they can just work on the things that will make the most difference in their swings and results.It takes a lot of reps and a good amount of time to make any swing change. For example, if you work for 2 months and 10,000 reps to get a perfectly flat left wrist at the top of the swing, after all of that work, you may not have dropped your handicap at all. Even worse, as we get focused on small pieces of the swing, larger and more important pieces, can fall apart.If you spend the same amount of time working on the &#8220;Power Turn&#8221; from my system, you may pick up 20 yards on your drives.My system works with the Pareto Principle, which says you will get most of your results from just a few key things. Based on my experience, five things determine 95% of the results.With the system that I teach now, I focus on the 5 most important things you can do for your swing for power, consistency, and a lower handicap. You can take Nicklaus, Hogan, Woods, Norman, Palmer, and every other great golfer, and they all do these five things well.The reason is that those moves matter to the physics of hitting a golf ball well. Yet 95% of all amateur golfers do not do these 5 things!Learn the few important pieces that all pros do and none of the amateurs do, mix in some hard work, and you&#8217;ll improve your game drastically.<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Do your members really improve with the Top Speed Golf System?<\/h4>\n<p>Great question!
