I\u2019m so confident in the quality of the instruction I provide that I\u2019m going out of my way to get you to try it out. I can help more golfers like you reach their full potential. And you can play the best golf of your life. Everybody wins. It\u2019s as simple as that.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Here\u2019s&nbsp;<strong>another reason<\/strong> you should seriously consider this special invitation.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The \u201cHidden\u201d Benefits of All Access Membership\u2026<\/h2>\n<p style=\"\">As an&nbsp;<span><strong><span>All Access<\/span><\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;Member, you\u2019re a VIP in the&nbsp;<strong>Top Speed Golf<\/strong>&nbsp;community.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">That means you get exclusive access to certain programs I don\u2019t make available to everyone else who is not as committed to improving their games as you are\u2026<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">The&nbsp;<em><strong>Ball Striking Masterclass<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp;is a great example.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"\">If you struggle with making consistently solid contact.

Cancel anytime at all right from your account page.While I&#8217;ll hate to see you leave, the last thing I want to do is keep you here if you don&#8217;t want to be. You deserve better than that.Also, I personally hate it when membership sites I use make it hard to cancel, so I made sure there&#8217;s a simple process.<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"\">Are your System videos on YouTube?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"\">You&#8217;ve gotten a TON of free instruction from us on YouTube (and will continue to get more). That&#8217;s our gift to you.<strong>But every video inside the Top Speed Golf System courses are 100% exclusive to this website. We won&#8217;t release these anywhere else.<\/strong>That&#8217;s partly because they take you step-by-step through the training, building on one another. It&#8217;s simply impossible to do a proper course-based system like this on YouTube.And of course, it&#8217;s also because paying members deserve to get stuff no one else does.So, with your All Access Membership, you&#8217;re going to get videos you&#8217;ve never seen before (and will never see anywhere else), as well as a true, structured, systematic learning program to maximize your playing ability.YouTube&#8217;s great &#8212; but you need more than it can offer.

So, the value has grown tremendously from when we first launched.And there&#8217;s more coming!To continue providing what you want and need, we do expect to charge more before long.But think of how smart you&#8217;ll feel when you&#8217;re paying way less than everyone who misses out on this offer :-)I recommend you lock in your rate today because you&#8217;ll be protected from any future price increases.<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"\">Is your checkout process secure?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"\">I take site security very seriously.You can see we have enacted full site SSL (the green lock in the address bar), which is rare outside the banking industry.In fact, I had more than one person tell me that we were overdoing it for a site like ours. But the last thing I want is any security issues or our members feeling uneasy about our trustworthiness.In addition, <strong>we do not collect or store any of your credit card data<\/strong> on our site\/server.
