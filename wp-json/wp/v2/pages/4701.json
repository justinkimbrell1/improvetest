There are lots of misconceptions about distance. Once you understand \u2026 <em>and overcome<\/em> \u2026 these misconceptions, you\u2019ll know how to get more distance in YOUR game.<\/h3>\n<p><strong>DISTANCE MISCONCEPTION #1. I NEED TO SPEND $550 ON A NEW DRIVER \u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2026 I love all the technology that\u2019s out there today. And if you have a driver made from persimmon, or if your driver is more than 5 years old, then a new driver will likely help with some distance.<\/p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the truth.<\/p>\n<p>The USGA and the R&amp;A have organized the rules so that the ball speed from every driver is going to be the same when YOU hit the middle of the face.<\/p>\n<p>Some drivers offer more forgiveness than others \u2026 plus some adjustability.<\/p>\n<p>But 30 extra yards with a new driver? <em>Keep dreaming<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>However \u2026 combine a new driver with a lot more speed and NOW WE\u2019RE TALKING. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always talking about gaining clubhead speed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DISTANCE MISCONCEPTION #2. I\u2019ll STRETCH AND WORK OUT AND LOSE WEIGHT \u2026 AND I\u2019LL GAIN 30 YARDS.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Get fit. Get limber. Get svelte. ALL GOOD THINGS TO DO.<\/p>\n<p>You might gain a little bit of extra clubhead speed but it might be 5 mph max. That\u2019s unless you can spend at least 10 hours a week, <em>every week<\/em>, working out.<\/p>\n<p>Again \u2026 it\u2019s a great idea to get in great shape. But it\u2019s not going to help your distance in any meaningful way.<\/p>\n<p>And do you really have 10 hours a week to work out and go through all that sweating?<\/p>\n<p><strong>DISTANCE MISCONCEPTION #3. I\u2019LL MAKE A BIG SWING CHANGE.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes and no.<\/p>\n<p>Let me explain.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a high handicapper, or a serial slicer, then improved technique will help you gain distance.<\/p>\n<p>But if you hit the ball pretty straight most of the time, then a swing change might get you a bit more distance \u2026 but nothing significant.<\/p>\n<p>HOWEVER \u2026 if you organize some changes with the specific goal of REALLY INCREASING YOUR CLUBHEAD SPEED \u2026 then you\u2019ll make some big-time gains.<\/p>\n<p>And I\u2019ll show you how to make these changes in a minute. Stay tuned. They\u2019re really easy to make.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DISTANCE MISCONCEPTION #4. IF I TRY TO ADD MORE DISTANCE \u2026 I\u2019LL GET WILD OFF THE TEE \u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I fully understand why you\u2019re thinking this way. It\u2019s because you\u2019ve been told \u201cstay in control and keep it straight as an arrow.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s OK with short game and putting \u2026 but data shows that people with more clubhead speed are EVEN MORE ACCURATE than golfers who are trying to slow it down to stay in control.<\/p>\n<p>And a bit further down this page, I\u2019m going to show you some data about distance from the PGA Tour.<\/p>\n<p>My students will tell you \u2026 \u201cI\u2019ve gone through the distance program and I became MORE accurate off the tee.\u201d In fact, 86% of golfers who went through this program said they maintained or increased their accuracy.<\/p>\n<p>Again \u2026 the data supports this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DISTANCE MISCONCEPTION #5. I MUST DRIVE IT IN THE FAIRWAY ALL THE TIME.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Rory McIlroy is one of the best golfers on the planet. His driving accuracy percentage is 58.06%. He\u2019s 127th in driving accuracy on the PGA Tour, to be precise.<\/p>\n<p>So \u2026 more than 4 out of 10 drives DON\u2019T hit the fairway.<\/p>\n<p>The most accurate driver on tour right now is Ryan Armour. His accuracy percentage is 73.95%.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re in your office pool for the next major, are you taking Rory McIlroy or Ryan Armour?<\/p>\n<p>I know who I\u2019m picking!<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another question. Do you want to be 120 yards from the green in light rough or 190 yards from the green in the fairway?<\/p>\n<p>Rory McIlroy will give you the answer to that question.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll give you more stats from the PGA Tour in a minute.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, we all want to be in the fairway all the time but being in light rough isn\u2019t a disaster.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DISTANCE MISCONCEPTION #6. I MUST BUY SOME TRAINING AIDS\/GADGETS.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are some great gadgets out there. Some great training aids. Most of these will help you gain a little distance.<\/p>\n<p>But, in my experience as a teaching professional, even the better training aids will only give some incremental increases in clubhead speed.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe there\u2019s a gadget that\u2019s given you an extra 30 yards off the tee. But I haven\u2019t seen that one yet.<\/p>\n<p>Most training aids I\u2019ve seen are never going to hurt your game. But they\u2019re not going to give you massive clubhead speed gains either.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DISTANCE MISCONCEPTION #7. IT\u2019S THE CLUBS AND THE BALLS.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not exactly. Yes \u2026 the technology is helping with distance. But there are two things you need to know.<\/p>\n<p>First \u2026 technology has pretty much reached its limit due to the rules of the game.<\/p>\n<p>Second \u2026 it\u2019s clubhead speed that\u2019s made all the difference. Tiger Woods used to be the fastest \u2026 now there are many other pros who have higher clubhead speed than Tiger.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line \u2026 real gains in distance come from when you increase your clubhead speed.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>DISTANCE MISCONCEPTION #8. I\u2019M TOO OLD TO GET ANY GAINS.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Totally wrong.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a golfer then you\u2019re an athlete. And you can be an athlete at any age.<\/p>\n<p>Hundreds of golfers have taken my distance course and many are over the age of 70.<\/p>\n<p>Every golfer, including you, can get HUGE gains in clubhead speed.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe you\u2019ve seen your distance DECREASE despite technology and your other efforts. Here\u2019s something else that\u2019s happening.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The \u201cDownward Distance Death Spiral\u201d \u2026 The Reason That 99% of Golfers LOSE Distance \u2026 And NOBODY Talks About This \u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been studying the golf swing, and golf teaching, for a long time. And the word that keeps coming up again and again is \u2026 CONSISTENCY.<\/p>\n<p>A good thing.<\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s a problem.<\/p>\n<p>To get this consistency, teachers are telling their students to tighten up the swing \u2026 to make it shorter. There are two problems with this advice.<\/p>\n<p>One \u2026 it slows down clubhead speed.<\/p>\n<p>Two \u2026 there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019re going to get that magic \u201cconsistency.\u201d If you have an off day \u2026 you\u2019re not going to be consistent and you\u2019re back to square one.<\/p>\n<p><em>And when you have the off day, you will tighten up your swing even more and lose more distance.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"width: 100%;\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" width=\"234\" height=\"234\" title=\"Doodle_dontWantThis\" data-id=\"56293\" src=\"https:\/\/improve.topspeedgolf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Doodle_dontWantThis.png\" style=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Two things happen \u2026 you keep losing distance plus you shoot higher scores.

You have to train your brain to swing faster.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, you\u2019re telling your brain to make a tight, short, compact golf swing and keep it straight.<\/p>\n<p>But when you send a different message \u2026 \u201cget more clubhead speed\u201d to your brain \u2026 then your brain starts to tell your muscles to swing faster.<\/p>\n<p>At first, you\u2019ll get some more clubhead speed.<\/p>\n<p>It will be 3-10 extra miles per hour. Not too shabby.<\/p>\n<p>But the ball might start going in some weird directions.

A week or two ago I was probably 50 yards past the pond. Definitely a long drive there \u2026 my clubhead speed has increased from 100 mph to 120 mph.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>You start getting to where you&#8217;re hitting a lot shorter club for your second shot. That&#8217;s a huge difference \u2026 it feels like a natural swing to me, the swing speed is faster but the control is there too. I\u2019ve got a better focus. I\u2019m not thinking about the swing during the swing \u2026 as I progressed through the program and we got nearer to the end, I was seeing easily the 115 and 116 mph. Now I have a swing that feels more normal and I&#8217;m not having to try to kill it \u2026 the program has stuck with me already as the new normal. It&#8217;s gratifying.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">John Gochoco<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">GOOD FEELING TO COMPRESS A BALL \u2026 GLOWING \u2026<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just a good feeling to compress a ball \u2026 I understand what I&#8217;m trying to do \u2026 One of the most valuable things that you&#8217;ve taught me is how to practice \u2026 increased clubhead speed from 80 mph to over 100 mph \u2026 as part of my job I have to teach radiation physics to the radiology residents because they have to pass their board. They tell me I have a gift of imparting very difficult concepts so they can understand it and solve problems. I&#8217;m thinking to myself \u2026 \u2018Hey, you may think that but you haven&#8217;t seen this Clay Ballard guy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Dr. Steve Lieberman<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">DISTANCE CLASS UNLOCKED MY SWING<\/p>\n<p>The class gave me permission to swing hard \u2026 and I was proving to myself what swing speeds I could achieve \u2026 I was like \u2018wow, this is really cool.\u2019 I went from 86 mph to 103 mph \u2026 I\u2019m telling all my friends about it \u2026 the guys I like anyway \u2026 I\u2019m a lot more confident.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Ken Hedges<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">CONSISTENTLY LONGER<\/p>\n<p>I am so consistently longer now \u2026 that feels pretty good.

After finally giving in and joining, I couldn&#8217;t be happier with my decision to join Top Speed Golf! I almost feel guilt for getting such great instruction for this low price. At my age, golf is first and foremost, exercise in the fresh air on a beautiful course, with pleasant company. I&#8217;ve seen great improvement in my game since joining Top Speed Golf!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Dr. John O. Meadors<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">SWING FEELS SO MUCH BETTER \u2026 BEAT ALL MY FRIENDS \u2026<\/p>\n<p>Top Speed Golf has been the best investment for my golf game ever! I have spent thousands of dollars on lessons, but haven&#8217;t gotten the results that I&#8217;ve already seen from my All Access Membership. I love how Clay breaks the swing down into 5 Key Fundamentals. I now have the Top Speed Golf videos to review and practice with every day! My swing feels so much better and I can hardly wait to get back on the course and beat all my friends!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Mike Montgomery<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT<\/p>\n<p>You have a wonderful gift of taking a vast amount of material and condensing and organizing it into logical user friendly segments that are easy to understand and follow. Your basic 5 fundamentals of the swing are brilliant in their simplicity and application. Every time I pick up a club, I run through each of the fundamentals as a wellness checkup for my swing. In summary, having worked with the Top Speed Golf System for over a year now, I have seen significant improvements in my swing and in my game. Credit for the improvement goes to you and the TSG System, for providing a clear step by step path to improvement. The fundamentals of the TSG System allow me to practice and play with a clear understanding of what is required to properly execute the golf swing, so that I can swing and play with intention.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Gill Cole<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">CONTINUE TO IMPROVE<\/p>\n<p>At 68 years young and after having not played golf for nearly 25 years, I began getting the free lessons from Clay. The free instruction was so good that I HAD to have access to the entire system. I\u2019m so glad that I did as I\u2019ve discovered that TSG delivers a top quality set of instructions and game improvement disciplines, while also teaching a healthy method of playing. I honestly believe the Top Speed Golf System should be taught by high school and college coaches everywhere! I\u2019ve followed, sampled, watched and employed many internet-based golf study systems, and have taken great in-person lessons, but none have put forth such an effective instructional system of game improvement practice comparable to Top Speed Golf! Top Speed Golf can be utilized and initiated at any level of golfing expertise. It\u2019s a new way to learn and unfolds conceptual disciplines of instructions upon logical and helpful lines. The free lessons are great, but learning the \u201csystem\u201d is the way to find the true, lasting benefits of TSG. From the tee to the cup, you won\u2019t regret becoming a member of Top Speed Golf! As I continue to markedly improve my golf game through TSG, I encourage you to join us and enjoy learning along with us from our personal instructors at Top Speed Golf!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Stan Spadoni<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">CLUB<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">CHAMPION \u2026<\/p>\n<p>In my younger years, I played Division II college golf and as of late I have been our men\u2019s club champion for a number of years, so I didn\u2019t think online instruction would be for me. However, I hit a wall with my improvement, and watched my handicap keep going up instead of down, and lost much confidence in my entire game. I decided to give Top Speed Golf a chance and joined as an All Access Member. I started the year as a 6 handicap and finished below 3 while gaining approximately 7.5 yards per iron and 15 yards off the tee. I\u2019ve found that my All Access Membership helps my understanding of the golf swing and has made practice fun! I\u2019ve played and practiced more than I ever have in my golfing career since joining TSG because I have fun working through the \u201csystem.\u201d The short game section was also extremely beneficial and helped me get back to the basics. I really look forward to continue working through the system and continue to learn. I find Clay\u2019s instruction fascinating! I fully recommend TSG because of the simplicity of the system and how well Clay explains the instruction. Thank you Top Speed Golf!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Dan Frederickson<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">HANDICAP DROPPED FROM 12 TO 7<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve tried other online instruction and have taken expensive in-person lessons with multiple instructors and my game never really improved. Because of this, I was hesitant to join Top Speed Golf. I could see from the free lessons that Clay\u2019s method of teaching was easy to understand and was very insightful, so I decided to give it a shot. I\u2019m so glad that I did as the \u201csystem\u201d really works and my handicap has dropped from a 12 to a 7 in a matter of months! I now understand my swing in a way that makes sense to me and can now diagnose any issues that arise in my swing. I am much more confident on the course now! I was initially hooked by the \u2018Straight Line Release\u2019 concept and now I stick to the entire system completely! I fully recommend Top Speed Golf because it works! The information is presented logically, and in precise, easy to understand terms. Your handicap will go down, you will hit longer drives, and you will compress your irons more. Overall, it just makes the game much more fun!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Mike Gibson<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">BEST DECISION I EVER MADE FOR MY GOLF GAME<\/p>\n<p>Just wanted to let you guys know that I believe signing up for Top Speed Golf is going to be the best decision I ever made for my golf game! I was reluctant to sign up for TSG because I had previously been a member of a program that did nothing but confuse me by giving me conflicting information by multiple instructors. I have been stuck bouncing between a 7 &amp; 9 handicap for years, I am convinced that with your system I am going to break that plateau. I would recommend TSG to anyone who wants to understand the golf swing and learn it through a systematic approach instead of bouncing around from golf tip to golf tip.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Dan C.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">CRANKING MY DRIVES<\/p>\n<p>I had been looking through YouTube for a good online golf swing tutorial and came across Top Speed Golf. I noticed the articulation that Clay and Robin delivered. While the random videos were useful, I needed a systematic approach to follow, so I decided to become an All Access Member of Top Speed Golf. Once I began watching and participating in the drills, I noticed the attention to the details! Wow! I started doing the drills and putting in the reps and I could feel things were changing. I started to not be so \u2018ball bound\u2019 meaning I was developing my swing through the drills and then at the range, and the golf ball was merely \u2018getting in the way.\u2019 The best part of TSG is the detailed instruction. I especially like \u2018The Move.\u2019 Once I got it down, I started making better impact, and (oh my goodness!) I started cranking my drives! The contact on my irons also improved and I started getting the attention of my playing partners. I&#8217;ve been playing golf for 3.5 years, and with the help of TSG, I hope to break 80 real soon!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">F.J. Jiun<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">VERY AFFORDABLE<\/p>\n<p>I typically don&#8217;t write testimonials, but I felt the need to give one to Top Speed Golf. The Top Speed Golf System is very easy to understand and the drills are excellent tools to help you improve. If you follow the system step by step and put the work in, you&#8217;re guaranteed to improve tremendously! I fully recommend Top Speed Golf for many reasons. It&#8217;s very affordable, gives you unlimited access to incredible resources, and the instruction is second to none. Top Speed Golf has a very serious and dedicated team that puts the customer first.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Jack Widger, PGA Professional<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">GIVEN ME FOCUS \u2026 CLUBHEAD SPEED PICKING UP \u2026<\/p>\n<p>I am absolutely enjoying the Top Speed Golf progression! I have taken countless lessons from my fellow club professionals and have read many of the old classic and current teaching books. The minute I saw an introduction video on the internet of the way Clay explained the straight line release, I was wowed, and said that \u2018I can see what Clay is saying, but I&#8217;m not doing that\u2019. The program has really given me focus. I have never had impact positions and angles explained so well and in such detail. It just made sense the way Clay breaks it down. Just started the &#8220;Power Turn&#8221; and can honestly say I am wowed again! I have never protracted and retracted my shoulders and it feels great. I can already see my club head speed picking up. This series will no doubt improve my teaching skills as a Club Professional and will hopefully pay off when I play against my peers next spring. Great work on this program! Love it!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Simon Clarke<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">PURE GOLD<\/p>\n<p>I just wanted to let you guys know that I&#8217;ve been signed up for TSG now for only 3 days, I went to the range today and all I can say is wow! I&#8217;ve played golf on and off since I was 10, I&#8217;m now 54 and I have never hit the ball like I did today. Using a camera to film myself yesterday revealed some major faults in my swing, biggest being over the top swing path, which I&#8217;ve struggled to correct since forever. So I had a look through what you had in the vault and came across the video &#8220;G051. How to Shallow the Club with Gravity in Your Golf Swing.&#8221; Man, that is pure gold! I have never heard this anywhere else, how simple, relax and just let the club and gravity do the work. If the only thing I get from your course is that, then I would be totally happy with the money spent. I have made more progress in the last 2 days than in my entire lifetime. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I can&#8217;t wait to see what else is in store as I work through the course.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Thad Leffingwell, Ph.D. Sports Psychologist (Oklahoma State University)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">LOWEST NINE I\u2019VE EVER SHOT \u2026 32 \u2026<\/p>\n<p>Excited to share with you how happy I am with my progress. The lowest nine I&#8217;ve ever shot &#8230; This afternoon I shot a 32! I had five birdies in nine holes. I putted for eagle twice, driving a par four and reaching a par five in two. You&#8217;ll notice on the card I was using the &#8216;six threes&#8217; approach which also helped me go lower. I&#8217;m hitting it farther and straighter than I have in 35 years of golf. The most exciting thing to me is that my swing is consistent. Before I learned your system and really understood my swing, I would have good ball-striking days because I tweaked one thing, then the next day I wouldn&#8217;t and would spend the next several weeks trying to find a new tweak. Now I understand my swing and can understand what I&#8217;m doing based on ball flight and contact. I&#8217;m loving golf and having fun again.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Chris Hunsucker<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">PRO SHOOTS 59!

I get this one a lot. There are three things to understand about the 20 Minute Distance Fix.<\/p>\n<p>First, while distance is obviously the focus of the 20 Minute Distance Fix, every single instructional video uses Neural Adaption Practice methods to improve your technique and eliminate power leaks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll work on sequencing, creating powerful lag, releasing properly for speed, rotation, weight shift, and much more. And you\u2019ll get results (i.e., tons more distance) from all these things much faster thanks to how I teach them (using Neural Adaption Practice).<\/p>\n<p>Second, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard the old saying&#8230; &#8220;Drive for show, putt for dough.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Forget it&#8230; Because if you&#8217;re driving the ball less than 250 yards, you won&#8217;t be playing for much dough \u2026 or for a low score.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is that there&#8217;s a very strong correlation between swing speed and handicap. In fact, TrackMan research found that the highest correlation with handicap was swing speed.<\/p>\n<p>On average, for every 1 mph of swing speed you gain, you can drop one stroke off your handicap.<\/p>\n<p>You can have great technique and ball striking skills, but if you can only muster around 90 mph of swing speed with your driver, you&#8217;ll struggle to lower your handicap.<\/p>\n<p>Why?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Because if you&#8217;re a short hitter, you&#8217;ll be faced with long approach shots on par 4s and your birdie opportunities will be slim to none on par 5s.<\/p>\n<p>You see, the vast majority of birdies are made on par 5s (that goes for PGA Tour players as well).<\/p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re struggling with distance, you&#8217;ll struggle on the score sheet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, you can make serious gains in speed and distance faster than just about any other part of your game.<\/p>\n<p>For example, after our pilot students went through the drills in just the very first video \u2026 they gained around 15 yards on average.<\/p>\n<p>And after the first week of training, that average jumped to 20+ yards.<\/p>\n<p>That means you\u2019ll be shooting lower scores and having tons more fun in no time.<\/p>\n<p>And once you\u2019re happy with your distance, you\u2019ll be ready to start the Top Speed Golf System to learn the same techniques every great player in history has used in their swings.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Question: Am I too inflexible or out of shape for this?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Absolutely not! The data from our pilot group showed that students who considered themselves less flexible actually improved slightly more than those who considered themselves very flexible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>And while being in really good shape gives you even more potential for huge distance gains, players at all levels of fitness gained a minimum of 30.5 yards on their best drives.<\/p>\n<p>You see, I&#8217;ve created all my instruction so that players of all levels can improve. Other swing systems these days are really just built for hyper-flexible, super-fit professionals.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not the best way for recreational players to maximize their potential, though.<\/p>\n<p>So, you can start with my instruction knowing it&#8217;s catered to YOU and not to \u2018freak\u2019 athletes like Dustin Johnson or Adam Scott.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Question:&nbsp; Am I too old for this?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Nope! In the pilot group, students over 50, over 60, and over 70 actually gained a little more distance than those under 50. (Though all age groups gained 30+ yards on average.)<\/p>\n<p>In fact, 20 Minute Distance Fix helped multiple seniors reach Champions Tour level swing speeds!<\/p>\n<p>From the beginning, I&#8217;ve designed all my instructional courses so they help players of all ages. And much of the time, the more &#8220;experienced&#8221; players improve the most.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Question: If this is a 3-week course, why do I have to purchase an auto-renewing membership?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Because adding 20 to 70 yards in 3 weeks (or less) is only the beginning! I&#8217;ve got nearly 20 additional video courses to transform your <em>entire<\/em> game.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the journey you&#8217;re about to embark on &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Step 1: Boom drives 10 to 20 yards farther (in one day!).<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: Gain 10 to 50 MORE yards off the tee.<\/p>\n<p>Step 3: Create consistently clean contact.<\/p>\n<p>Step 4: Become a ball striking master.<\/p>\n<p>Step 5: Swing like the greatest players of all time.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, yeah, there are no commitments at all, and you\u2019re totally free to cancel your membership at any time so that it won\u2019t renew again. It\u2019s super simple to do this right from your account page on the website or by calling us.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Question: Do I have enough time to go through this course?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Well, I\u2019ve got good news and \u2026 better news for you here. No bad news \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that I created this training the way I develop all my instructional products, to get you the biggest bang in the shortest time possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I asked, \u201cwhat are the very small number of adjustments that will get someone 80% or more of the total distance they can realistically achieve?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And those very few adjustments are all that I cover in this course.<\/p>\n<p>Because of that, you only need to be able to swing fast for 20 minutes per day, 3 times per week for 3 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s basically just a total of 3 hours doing the drills. Crazy, huh!<\/p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the best part\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Students in our pilot program literally got almost 50% of their total improvement in the first 20 minute session in the course!!!<\/p>\n<p>So, even if you start your membership today and only do that very first training session, you will enjoy game-changing results.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I can\u2019t tell you if you\u2019ve got 3 hours or even 20 minutes to start hitting longer drives, lowering your scores, and having tons more fun (of course, I\u2019d like to think you have that tiny amount of time).<\/p>\n<p>But I CAN tell you I know of no other video instruction that can possibly make it less time consuming for you.<\/p>\n<p>So, get started right now, and you could add 15 yards or more \u2026 potentially within the next hour if you aren\u2019t too far away from a driving range!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #FFFFFF;\">&#169;
