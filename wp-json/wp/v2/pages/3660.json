That&#8217;s our gift to you.<strong>But every video inside the Top Speed Golf System courses are 100% exclusive to this website. We won&#8217;t release these anywhere else.<\/strong>That&#8217;s partly because they take you step-by-step through the training, building on one another. It&#8217;s simply impossible to do a proper course-based system like this on YouTube.And of course, it&#8217;s also because paying members deserve to get stuff no one else does.So, with your All Access Membership, you&#8217;re going to get videos you&#8217;ve never seen before (and will never see anywhere else), as well as a true, structured, systematic learning program to maximize your playing ability.YouTube&#8217;s great &#8212; but you need more than it can offer.

So, the value has grown tremendously from when we first launched.And there&#8217;s more coming!To continue providing what you want and need, we do expect to charge more before long.But think of how smart you&#8217;ll feel when you&#8217;re paying way less than everyone who misses out on this offer :-)I recommend you lock in your rate today because you&#8217;ll be protected from any future price increases.<\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"\">Is your checkout process secure?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"\">I take site security very seriously.You can see we have enacted full site SSL (the green lock in the address bar), which is rare outside the banking industry.In fact, w<strong>e got an &#8220;A&#8221; rating on the highly respected Qualys SSL Labs check<\/strong>.That ranks higher than the huge bank Wells Fargo!In fact, I had more than one person tell me that we were overdoing it for a site like ours. But he last thing I want is any security issues or our members feeling uneasy about our trustworthiness.In addition, <strong>we do not collect or store any of your credit card data<\/strong> on our site\/server.
